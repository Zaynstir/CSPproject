## Welcome to Form-Mal's Privacy Policy.

What are you allowing us to do by downloading this extension?
1. Read and change website data
2. Record data on a Google Sheet
3. Use the data in any way we see fit

Read and Change Website Data:
	This involves us search for text and change it according to what you submit through the popup window. This also gives us the ability read data that is in the submission forms.

Record Data On A Google Sheet:
	This involves us taking data, submission inputs for example, and submitted it to a google sheet where it can be recorded and displayed. Do not worry this will not cause any extra lag on your end.

Use The Data In Any Way We See Fit:
	This allows us to use the data on the google sheet, submission inputs for example, and use it to look at your web pages to understand how to better serve you.

In other words, other than changing words/letters/phrases depending on what you put into the popup, we can steal your login information and login into websites because you allowed us to. No, we have no plans on selling or giving away your login information.

### Want to know how to make it yours?
1. Go to matrix.js (Assuming you have everything downloaded) and copy everything starting from "$.ajax({" to the "});//End of .ajax". 
2. Paste it right above the "$.ajax({".
	*Need to do steps 1 & 2 otherwise the program will most likely not work*
3. You need to make a google form and link it to a google spreadsheet.
4. Have three short answer response questions.
5. Right click the first input text box and go to inspect element.
6. Find the name of the input text field (i.e. entry.00000101).
7. Copy the whole name and go to matrix.js (Assuming you have everything downloaded).
8. Find the .ajax that you pasted and input the name into its respected field underneath the comment (comments look like this //).
9. Repeat Steps 5-8 two more times to copy and paste the 2nd and 3rd input fields into matrix.js.
10. Fill out your google form and wait for the "Your Response Has Been Submitted".
11. Copy the URL and go back to the .ajax inside matrix.js and change the current url to that.
12. Save all files that you editied.
13. Go to chrome://extensions/.
14. Turn on developer mode.
15. Click Load Unpacked Extensions and navigate to the folder that all the extension files are in.
16. If there are erros, figure it out and try again. Otherwise it should be enabled once you press 'OK'.
17. Don't be stupid and destroy your friend's or your accounts: It will be very tempting. 
18. Lastly, this will not work on every website (i.e. Github). We are still troubleshooting this.
